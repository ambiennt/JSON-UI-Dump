# JSON-UI-Dump

## Disclaimer:
The information here was dumped directly from the Minecraft binary via string searching with specific prefixes (and manually combing out obvious outliers). None of the information here has been tested by me. Moreover, it's likely possible that not *all* types are included here. For example, sometimes Mojang likes to concatenate different strings to produce new bindings, buttons, etc., which are more difficult to single out and reverse engineer.

[Here](https://www.diffchecker.com/) is a good online file diff checker to compare the changes between Minecraft Bedrock versions.
